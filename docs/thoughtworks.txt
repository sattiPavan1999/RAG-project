History
1980s–1990s
In the late 1980s, Roy Singham founded Singham Business Services as a management consulting company servicing the equipment leasing industry in a Chicago basement. According to Singham, after two-to-three years, Singham started recruiting additional staff and came up with the name Thoughtworks in 1990.[8] The company was incorporated under the new name in 1993 and focused on building software applications.[9] Over time, Thoughtworks' technology shifted from C++ and Forte 4GL in the mid-1990s to include Java in the late 1990s.[citation needed]

Martin Fowler joined the company in 1999 and became its chief scientist in 2000.[10]

In 2001, Thoughtworks agreed to settle a lawsuit by Microsoft for $480,000 for deploying unlicensed copies of office productivity software to employees.[11]

Also in 2001, Fowler, Jim Highsmith, and other key software figures authored the Agile Manifesto.[12] The company began using agile techniques while working on a leasing project.[13] Thoughtworks' technical expertise expanded with the .NET Framework in 2002,[14] C# in 2004, Ruby and the Rails platform in 2006.[15] In 2002, Thoughtworks chief scientist Martin Fowler wrote "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" with contributions by ThoughtWorkers David Rice and Matthew Foemmel, as well as outside contributors Edward Hieatt, Robert Mee, and Randy Stafford.[16]
